A genetic algorithm written in Python3

## Set-up

Clone the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/almorcrette/genetic-algorithm-python
```

Navigate to directory.

Check you have the following properly installed:
- `python3 --version` should return something like `Python 3.9.12`
- `pip --version` should return something like `pip 22.1.2 from <local path to site packages of python3 version>`
- `pipenv --version` should return something like `pipenv, version 2022.6.7`


- A README.md file in the root folder of your repo
- The title of the project
- What the project is/what it does
- How to install it (what to clone, what to run to get all dependencies)
- How to run it (is it a command line tool? Do you have to load it into IRB? Is it a web application? What port needs to be used?)
- How to run the tests
